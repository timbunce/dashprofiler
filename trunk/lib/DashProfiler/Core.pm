package DashProfiler::Core;

=head1 NAME

DashProfiler::Core - DashProfiler core object and sampler factory

=head1 SYNOPSIS

See L<DashProfiler::UserGuide> for a general introduction.

DashProfiler::Core is currently viewed as an internal class. The interface may change.
The DashProfiler and DashProfiler::Import modules are the usual interfaces.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A DashProfiler::Core objects are the core of the DashProfiler, naturally.
They sit between the 'samplers' that feed data into a core, and the DBI::Profile
objects that aggregate those samples. A core may have multiple samplers and
multiple profiles.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 new

  $obj = DashProfiler::Core->new( 'foo' );

  $obj = DashProfiler::Core->new( 'bar', { ...options... } );

  $obj = DashProfiler::Core->new( extsys => {
      granularity => 10,
      flush_interval => 300,
  } );

Creates and returns a DashProfiler::Core object.

=head2 Options for new()

=head3 disabled

Set to a true value to prevent samples being added to this core. If true, the
prepare() method and the L<DashProfiler::Sample> new() method will return undef.

Default false.

Currently, any existing samples that were active will still be added when they
terminate. This behaviour may change.

See also L<DashProfiler::Import>.

=head3 dbi_profile_class

Specifies the class to use for creating DBI::Profile objects.
The default is C<DBI::Profile>. Alternatives include C<DBI::ProfileDumper>
and C<DBI::ProfileDumper::Apache>.

=head3 dbi_profile_args

Specifies extra arguments to pass the new() method of the C<dbi_profile_class>
(e.g., C<DBI::Profile>). The default is C<{ }>.

=head3 flush_interval

How frequently the DBI:Profiles associated with this core should be written out
and the data reset. Default is 0 - no regular flushing.

=head3 flush_hook

If set, this code reference is called when flush() is called and can influence
its behaviour. For example, this is the flush_hook used by L<DashProfiler::Auto>:

    flush_hook => sub {
        my ($self, $dbi_profile_name) = @_;
        warn $_ for $self->profile_as_text($dbi_profile_name);
        return $self->reset_profile_data($dbi_profile_name);
    },

See L</flush> for more details.

=head3 granularity

The default C<Path> for the DBI::Profile objects doesn't include time.
The granularity option adds 'C<!Time~$granularity>' to the front of the Path.
So as time passes the samples are aggregated into new sub-trees.

=head3 sample_class

The sample_class option specifies which class should be used to take profile samples.
The default is C<DashProfiler::Sample>.
See the L</prepare> method for more information.

=head3 period_summary

Specifies the name of an extra DBI Profile object to attach to the core.
This extra 'period summary' profile is enabled and reset by the start_sample_period()
method and disabled by the end_sample_period() method.

The mechanism enables a single profile to be used to capture both long-running
sampling (often with C<granularity> set) and single-period (e.g., for a 'debug'
footer on a generated web page)

=head3 period_exclusive

When using periods, via the start_sample_period() and end_sample_period() methods,
DashProfiler can add an additional sample representing the time between the
start_sample_period() and end_sample_period() method calls that I<wasn't>
accounted for by the samples.

The period_exclusive option enables this extra sample. The value of the option
is used as the value for key1 and key2 in the Path.

=head3 period_strict_start

See L</start_sample_period>.

=head3 period_strict_end

See L</end_sample_period>.

=head3 profile_as_text_args

A reference to a hash containing default formatting arguments for the profile_as_text() method.

=head3 extra_info

Can be used to attach any extra information to the profiler core object. That can be useful sometimes in callbacks.

  $sample_overhead_time = DashProfiler::Core->estimate_sample_overheads();

Estimates and returns the approximate minimum time overhead for taking a sample.
Two times are returned. The following timeline diagram explains the difference:

    previous statement      -------------                              
                                      |

    next statement          -------------   = sample_overhead_time       

For estimate_sample_overheads() there are no I<measured statements> so the
times reflect the pure overheads.

Note that because estimate_sample_overheads() uses a tight loop, the timings
returned are likely to be I<slightly> smaller then the timings you'd get in
practice due to CPU L2 caches and other factors. This is okay.
On my 2GHz laptop running OS X 10.5.2 $sample_overhead_time is 0.000014 and
$sample_inner_time is 0.000003. (When doing occasional sampling the
sample_overhead_time is 0.000002 to 0.000003 higher, in case you care.)

DashProfiler automatically calls estimate_sample_overheads() when loading and
records the returned values.  It then uses the C<sample_overhead_time> to
adjust the L</period_exclusive> time to more accrately reflect the time not
covered by the accumulated samples.  Currently the C<sample_inner_time> is
I<not> subtracted from the individual samples. That may change in future.

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

=head2 attach_dbi_profile

  $core->attach_dbi_profile( $dbi_profile, $name );

Attaches a DBI Profile to a DashProfiler::Core object using the $name given.
Any later samples are also aggregated into this DBI Profile.

Not normally called directly. The new() method calls attach_dbi_profile() to
attach the "main" profile and the C<period_summary> profile, if enabled.

The $dbi_profile argument can be either a DBI::Profile object or a string
containing a DBI::Profile specification.

The get_dbi_profile($name) method can be used to retrieve the profile.

Returns a reference to the DBI Profile object that attached to the $core with the given name.
If $dbi_profile_name is undef then it defaults to "main".
Returns undef if there's no profile with that name atached.
If $dbi_profile_name is 'C<*>' then it returns all attached profiles.

Returns the aggregated data from the specified DBI Profile (default "main") formatted as a string.
Calls L</get_dbi_profile> to get the DBI Profile, then calls the C<as_text> method on the profile.
See L<DBI::Profile> for more details of the parameters.

In list context it returns one item per profile leaf node, in scalar context
they're concatenated into a single string. Returns undef if the named DBI
Profile doesn't exist.

in all the attached profiles are visited.

=head2 propagate_period_count

  $core->propagate_period_count( $dbi_profile_name )

Sets the count field of all the leaf-nodes in the named DBI Profile to the
number of times start_sample_period() has been called since the last flush() or
reset_profile_data().  If the profile has a time granularity set then the count
value used is the total period count divided by the number of separate
sub-trees of profile data.

If $dbi_profile_name is "*" then counts in all attached profiles are set.

This method is especially useful where the number of sample I<periods> are much
more relevant than the number of samples. This is typically the case where
sample periods correspond to major units of work, such as web requests.
Using propagate_period_count() lets you calculate averages based on the count
of I<periods> instead of samples.

Imagine, for example, that you're instrumenting a web application and you have
a function that sends a request to some network service and another reads each
line of the response.  You'd add DashProfiler sampler calls to each function.
The number of samples recorded in the leaf node will depends on the number of
lines in the response from the network service.

By default the time/count will give you the "average time spent in a network
service related function" but you're much more likely to want to know the
"average total time spent handling the network service per http request".
If that is the case, then use propagate_period_count().

This method is typically called just before a flush(), often via C<flush_hook>.

=head2 flush

  $core->flush()
  $core->flush( $dbi_profile_name )

Calls the C<flush_hook> code reference, if set, passing it $core and the
$dbi_profile_name augument (which is typically undef).  If the C<flush_hook>
code returns a non-empty list then flush() does nothing more except return that
list.

If C<flush_hook> wasn't set, or it returned an empty list, then the flush_to_disk()
method is called for the named DBI Profile (defaults to "main", use "*" for all).
In this case flush() returns a list of the DBI::Profile objects flushed.

    return @dbi_profiles;
}


=head2 flush_if_due

  $core->flush_if_due()

Returns nothing if C<flush_interval> was not set.
Returns nothing if C<flush_interval> was set but insufficient time has passed since
the last call to flush_if_due().
Otherwise notes the time the next flush will be due, and calls C<return flush();>.

    $bool = $core->has_profile_data
    $bool = $core->has_profile_data( $dbi_profile_name )

}


=head2 start_sample_period

  $core->start_sample_period

Marks the start of a series of related samples, e.g, within one http request.

If end_sample_period() has not been called for this core since the last
start_sample_period() then the value of the C<period_strict_start> attribute
determines the actions taken:

  0 = restart the period, silently
  1 = restart the period and issue a warning (this is the default)
  2 = continue the current period, silently
  3 = continue the current period and issue a warning
  4 = call end_sample_period(), silently
  5 = call end_sample_period() and issue a warning

If the value is a CODE ref then it's called (and passed $core) and the return value used.

Resets the C<period_accumulated> attribute to zero.
Sets C<period_start_time> to the current dbi_time().
If C<period_summary> is enabled then the period_summary DBI Profile is enabled and reset.

See also L</end_sample_period>, the C<period_summary> option, and L</propagate_period_count>.

=head2 end_sample_period

  $core->end_sample_period

Marks the end of a series of related samples, e.g, within one http request.

If start_sample_period() has not been called for this core since the last
end_sample_period() (or the start of the script) then the value of the
C<period_strict_end> attribute determines the actions taken:

  0 = do nothing, silently (this is the default)
  1 = do nothing but warn
  2 = call start_sample_period(), silently
  3 = call start_sample_period() and warn

If the value is a CODE ref then it's called (and passed $core) and the return value used.
If start_sample_period() isn't called then end_sample_period() just returns.

The C<period_count> attribute is incremented.

If C<period_exclusive> is enabled then a sample is added with a duration
caclulated to be the time since start_sample_period() was called to now, minus
the time accumulated by samples since start_sample_period() was called.

Resets the C<period_start_time> attribute to 0.  If C<period_summary> is
enabled then the C<period_summary> DBI Profile is disabled and returned, else
undef is returned.

See also L</start_sample_period>, C<period_summary> and L</propagate_period_count>.

  $sampler_code_ref->( $context2 )
  $sampler_code_ref->( $context2, $start_time )

Returns a reference to a subroutine that will create sampler objects.
In effect the prepare() method creates a 'factory'.

The sampler objects created by the returned code reference are pre-set to use
$context1, and optionally $context2, as their context values.

If the appropriate value for C<context2> won't be available until the end of
the sample you can set $context2 to a code reference. The reference will be
executed at the end of the sample. See L<DashProfiler::Sample>.

XXX needs more info about %meta - see the code for now, it's not very complex.

See L<DashProfiler::Sample> for more information.
